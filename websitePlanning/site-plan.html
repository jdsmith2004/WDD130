        <h2>Brainstorm</h2>
        <h3>Why will people come to your site?</h3>
        <p>
            The site will offer a unique experience allowing users to add and track goals right from the new tab screen.
            Additionaly it will
            display the weather and a personallized encouraging message as well as a quote. By using this people will be
            able to take control
            of their lives and start acomplishing their dreams.
        </p>
        <h2>What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them?</h2>
        <p>
            My website will not be designed to answer questions. I am building it because I know how hard it is for me
            to manage my time and want to develop a solution that others and I can both take advantage of to not only
            better oneself, but also have a visually appealing dashboard of exactly where and how much the improvements
            have taken place. When they come to the site, almost if not all of the users will have read the description
            on the chrome webstore describing the use case and purpose of my website. So when they first come it would
            be cool to have some sort of view where it gives the purpose in the middle of the screen and then some
            arrows pointing to different sections of the screen describing the purpose and use case for all of the
            buttons and widgets as well as where to go to make changes, for example the settings wheel would say
            "settings, go here for switching theme editing name, email, password, and so much more!" next to the arrow.
            Overall the goal of the website will Homely be to allow others to better themselves.
        </p>
        <h2>What types of activities will visitors want to complete on your site?</h2>
        <p>
            The answer for this question is pretty similar to the last one my website will be Homely productivy based
            and won't have any activities to participate in on the website. Some of the actions needed will be adding
            a name, email, and password. This will allow them to sign in, sync their data to the website and even
            download and sync their user profile across multiple browsers and computers.
        </p>
        <h2>What information is necessary to complete any actions your site offers?</h2>
        <p>
            No information will be required other than a name, email, and password as specified above.
        </p>
        <h2>Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this information or complete the actions?
        </h2>
        <p>
            To my knowledge, I'm not aware of any competitors with any similar functions to my website. However, if by
            some miracle this idea ends up taking off and my website is succesfull my website will have to have
            advantages over the other websites in a similar doHome. In order to do that, now that I'm starting ahead I
            will have to stay ahead. I believe one of the best ways to develop and Hometain an advantage is crowd
            sourcing. I intend to add an idea suggestion/complaints spot somewhere in the website that will allow for
            idea suggestions. Next I'll make sure my website looks extremely clean and has minimal to no glitching as I
            push out updates. I'll have to have crisp animations that make the website feel alive and smooth color
            schemes and transitions as they check off their goals, evaluate their progress, etc.
        </p>
        <h2>How will users keep track of their goals, and their progress at completing them?</h2>
        <p>
            First off their will be a box at the bottom of the website with a row of spans 6 columns long that will put
            up a completion image after each goal is completed. Then my second page for the site will allow them to view
            their progress as a chart with the amount of total goals completed and also just the individual goals
            completed by percentage each month. I'm also considering adding a function where it shows a number in the
            middle of the checkbox that displays the days the goal has been checked off that week with an option to
            switch it to by month in settings. The other feature to be implemented will be a motivational message with
            their name at the end encouraging them to keep going and acopmlish their dreams.
        </p>
        <!-- WHITEWATER RAFTING -->
        <!-- <h2>What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them?</h2>
        <p>
            When they come to the website the customer will want first off know what whitewater rafting is. They will
            also want to know how much our service costs, how dangerous the rapids are, how long it will take, if they
            will need a guide and what the guide will do. They will want to know the reccomended age level is for the
            activity, if they need lifejackets etc. Becuase their are guaranteed to be so many questions, I will plan
            for this by adding my second webpage as a frequently asked questions page. It should maybe have a submission
            option for new questions as well as print out all the questions that have currently been asked and answered
            on the website.
        </p>
        <h2>What information is necessary to complete any actions your site offers?</h2>
        <p>
            This website will need a little bit more information than your average website because it will require the
            customer to
            fill out a form for liability purposes. The site will require a name, phone number, picture of some sort of
            legal ID or a social security number, as well as age, weight, any health conditions the customer has, a
            section for comments that asks them to right any worries or factors we should be aware about, a signature
            section, and if It's a child permission to take them rafting with the parent.
        </p>
        <h2>Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this information or complete the actions?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Because most whitewater companies are extremely similar, as in they all go down the same river, they all use
            the same type of raft even if the companies have different designs, they all have guides and go around the
            same times, etc. As a result of this my site will have to find differentiating itself from the other rafting
            sites in different ways. First the home page will have to be extremely welcoming and clean, urging the
            customer to continue looking through the site. I will have to add some sort of opening hook and maybe add
            some croud testing to see what others think of the current version and what improvements they would
            reccomended I add. Additionaly the frequently asked questions page will need to be extremely inuitive and
            welcoming urging the customer to have confidence in our rafting company and to just book with us before
            resesarching otherrafting companies.

        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>Have you every
            realized you were behind on your schedule and goals and wondered what
            happened? I pleased to tell you that I’m building a solution for that problem. I’d like to create
            an interactive chrome extension to fine tune your ability to manage your tasks and goal
            milestones. The extension will replace the new tab page and instead display the day, a
            motivational message, and in the top right a 2 by 3 grid filled with an abbreviation for your
            goals which can be checked off right there from the home tab. Additionally milestones and
            progress will be shown with the option to customize goals in settings.
        </p>
        <!--Website's Purpose -->
        <h3>Audience</h3>

            is no one we will not market to. After launch if we collect general user age info this will be subject to
